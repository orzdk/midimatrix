Hey all,

I just finished a new build that might be useful to others.

The project is a two-part project. Part one is a MIDI router/filter/modifier web-application, and part two is the hardware that runs it.

Software:

The software is a node.js backend with a jQuery frontend. Backend does everything using spawned child processes that simply runs aconnect & amidi for routing, and mididings for filters. The software has a point-click interface for building Mididings filters.

Simply connect any class compliant USB MIDI DIN interface and some USB units directly into the PI, and you will be able to route and filter MIDI messages between both classic and USB-only devices. 

For example, hook up a Roland UM-ONE Interface to the PI, then connect that to your classic synth that does not have USB. Then connect a AKAI LPK25 MIDI controller to the PI. Both units will show up in MIDIMatrix (automatically if usbdetect enabled, does not work on PZ)    

Then simply connect the two units by clicking one, then the other, and now all midi messages will be routed in the configured direction. 

The application has two screens, the main screen for.



Short version: KORG SQ-1 modded, is now a MIDI router/filter/host.
